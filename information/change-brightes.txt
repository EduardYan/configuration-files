This is a small program for change the brightness of display of our computer.

First we must know the display name.
so we execute this:
  xrandr --prop | grep " connected"


Now we must know the brigthness of display that is used.
  xrandr --prop --verbose | grep -A10 " connected" | grep "Brightness"
Us return the value of brightness current used.


Now we can change the brightness of display:
  xrandr --output Display_of_name --brightness 0.8
  xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness 0.8

  this is for change the brightness of display.
